# Ashish_Toppo_Portfolio
This is my portfolio to showcsae my knowledge and working methodology in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.
I have also done a complete documentation, please look into the attached pdf to each project.

# [Project 1  :Insurance Forecast ](https://github.com/Tashish97/Linear-Regression)
### Algorithm :Linear Regression
### Language  :R
### IDE       :RStudio

Description:
A Linear Regression Model with validating its assumptions.
Linear Regression is all about finding the best fit line.

This is project in which I applied Linear Regression Model, validating it's assumptions which are:
1. **Linearity** : This assumption assumes that each indepedent variable has a linear relationship with the Dependent Variable.
2. **Homoscedastity** : This assumption states that the residuals have less variance in residuals.
3. **Non-Multicollinearity** : This assumptions tells that the independent features must ne non-collinear.
4. **Normailty** : This assumptio states that the residuals are normally distributed.

# Work Done:
1. EDA on independent variable(s) and dependent variable and answering a few questions as per my knowledge using various visulizational techniques.
2. Wrote custom functions for various repetitive tasks.
3. Linearity assumption check on each independent variable.
4. Handling of outliers.
5. Removal of columns which do not satisfy the linear regression assumptions.
6. Validation of model using R-Square and residual plot. Which looks like the image below.

# [Project 2  :Insurance Forecast ](https://github.com/Tashish97/Linear-Regression)
### Algorithm :SVM(Support Vector Machines)
### Language  :R
### IDE       :RStudio

Description:
Using this data set I need to predict the whether a person will buy the product after seeing the advertisement.

A support vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm that sorts data into two categories. It is trained with a series of data already classified into two categories, building the model as it is initially trained. The task of an SVM algorithm is to determine which category a new data point belongs in. This makes SVM a kind of non-binary linear classifier.

An SVM algorithm should not only place objects into categories, but have the margins between them on a graph as wide as possible.
