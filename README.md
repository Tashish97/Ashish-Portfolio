# [Project 1: Multi Disease Prediction System](https://github.com/Tashish97/multiDiseasePredict)
**Type      :Classification, Regression**   
**Language  :Python**  
**Skills    :SVM, Logistic Regression, Streamlit**  
 
Problem Statement:  
To make an One Stop Web based application in Streamlit which gives access to **3 Types of disease prediction** which are as follows:  
1. Diabetes Prediction  
2. Heart Disease Prediction  
3. Parkinson's Prediction  
  
  This is a multipage application, giving users the ability to predict the above diseases in a single app.
