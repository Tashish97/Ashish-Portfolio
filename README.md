**This is my Project Portfolio to showcsae my knowledge and working methodology in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.**  
Please look into the attached pdf to each project for complete Project and it's Documentation.

# [Project 1  :Insurance Forecast ](https://github.com/Tashish97/Linear-Regression)  
**Type      :Regression**  
**Algorithm :Linear Regression**  
**Language  :R**  
**IDE       :RStudio**  

Description:
A Linear Regression Model with validating its assumptions.
Linear Regression is all about finding the best fit line.

This is project in which I applied Linear Regression Model, validating it's assumptions which are:
1. **Linearity** : This assumption assumes that each indepedent variable has a linear relationship with the Dependent Variable.
2. **Homoscedastity** : This assumption states that the residuals have less variance in residuals.
3. **Non-Multicollinearity** : This assumptions tells that the independent features must ne non-collinear.
4. **Normailty** : This assumptio states that the residuals are normally distributed.

## Work Done:
1. EDA on independent variable(s) and dependent variable and answering a few questions as per my knowledge using various visulizational techniques.
2. Wrote custom functions for various repetitive tasks.
3. Linearity assumption check on each independent variable.
4. Handling of outliers.
5. Removal of columns which do not satisfy the linear regression assumptions.
6. Validation of model using R-Square and residual plot. 


# [Project 2  :Social Network Ads ](https://github.com/Tashish97/SVM)  
**Type      :Classification**  
**Algorithm :SVM(Support Vector Machines)**  
**Language  :R**  
**IDE       :RStudio**  

Description:
Using this data set I need to predict the whether a person will buy the product after seeing the advertisement. SVM is to find a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes. An SVM algorithm should not only place objects into categories, but have the margins between them on a graph as wide as possible.

## Work Done:
1. EDA on independent variable(s) and dependent variable and answering a few questions as per my knowledge by using various visulizational techniques.
2. Feature Engineering using medical domain knowledge.
3. Data encoding with custom function for Normalization.
4. Hyperparameter tuning to find best parameters.
5. Validation of model using AUC_ROC and Confusion Matrix.
